# Fix AI System Prompts Editor Functionality

## Context

The AI System Prompts editor (accessible via AI menu â†’ Systemprompter tab, which is the default view when opening the AI menu) has severe usability issues that prevent users from effectively editing prompt content:

### Current Behavior
- **Auto-save on every keystroke:** The textarea in the main view triggers `handlePromptSave()` on every `onChange` event (line 625 in `Ai.jsx`), causing continuous API calls
- **Cursor position loss:** Due to immediate API calls and re-renders, the cursor jumps or loses position while typing
- **Text editing problems:** Users cannot continue writing smoothly, cannot properly select text, and copy/paste operations are disrupted
- **Modal button not functional:** While there's a maximize button (FiMaximize2 icon) to open a modal for larger editing, the underlying issues persist

### Expected Behavior
- Users should be able to type, edit, select, cut, copy, and paste text smoothly without interruptions
- Text cursor should remain stable at the correct position during editing
- A fully functional modal view should be available for expanded editing with proper save/cancel controls
- Changes should only be saved when explicitly requested (e.g., via Save button or Ctrl+S), not on every keystroke

### Business Value / Risk
- **High Priority:** This is a core feature for configuring AI behavior in the system
- **User Frustration:** Current implementation is nearly unusable, preventing proper system configuration
- **Data Integrity Risk:** Continuous auto-save on keystroke may save incomplete or malformed prompts

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Main textarea in Systemprompter tab allows smooth typing without cursor position issues
- [ ] Text selection, cut, copy, and paste operations work correctly in the main textarea
- [ ] Modal opens correctly when clicking the maximize button and provides a larger editing area
- [ ] Modal textarea has full editing functionality (typing, selecting, cut/copy/paste)
- [ ] Save functionality is explicit (button-based or keyboard shortcut), not triggered on every keystroke
- [ ] Auto-save is replaced with debounced save or manual save only
- [ ] Changes are properly tracked and can be discarded (Cancel button in modal)
- [ ] Unit/integration tests verify text editing functionality works correctly
- [ ] Manual testing confirms all editing operations work as expected
- [ ] Performance reviewed - no excessive API calls during editing

## Scope & Constraints

### In Scope:
- Fix textarea onChange behavior to prevent auto-save on every keystroke
- Implement proper state management to maintain cursor position
- Ensure modal editing works correctly with proper save/cancel flow
- Add debounced auto-save (optional) or explicit save button
- Maintain existing functionality for model selection and other fields

### Out of Scope:
- Adding new features beyond the described functionality
- Changing the overall UI/UX design
- Modifying backend API endpoints (unless necessary for the fix)
- Adding rich text editing capabilities

## Technical Notes

**File:** `main-system/app-frontend/src/ui/pages/Ai.jsx`

**Problem Areas:**
- Lines 623-628: textarea with `onChange` handler that immediately calls `handlePromptSave()`
- Lines 412-426: `handlePromptSave()` function makes immediate API call
- Lines 6-72: `PromptModal` component - verify this works correctly after fixing main editor

**Suggested Approach:**
1. Remove auto-save from onChange handler in main textarea
2. Add local state to track unsaved changes
3. Add explicit Save button or implement debounced save (500ms-1000ms delay)
4. Ensure modal properly manages its own state without affecting main view
5. Add keyboard shortcut support (Ctrl+S / Cmd+S) for save action
6. Consider adding visual indicator for unsaved changes
