# PR35 review – superseded by latest invoice OCR pipeline

## Summary
- Branch `pr35` introduces invoice OCR orchestration helpers (`_invoice_page_progress`, `_enqueue_invoice_ai_extraction`, etc.) and unit tests. These changes are already present (and extended) in `dev` via PR #42, which merged commit 5ad7e36.
- Attempting to merge `pr35` now causes conflicts in `backend/src/services/tasks.py` because `dev` has the newer `_maybe_advance_invoice_from_file` implementation.
- Running the branch as-is fails: `pytest backend/tests/unit/test_tasks_invoice_pipeline.py` aborts with `ValueError: Unknown constraint decimal_places` since the branch predates the Pydantic `condecimal` update now in `dev`.

## Recommendation
- Close PR #35 without merging; its functionality is already delivered in current `dev`.
- No action needed beyond confirming the PR can be closed or rebased to include the latest merged work (which would leave it empty).

## Evidence
- `git merge pr35 origin/dev` conflicts in `backend/src/services/tasks.py`
- `pytest backend/tests/unit/test_tasks_invoice_pipeline.py` → `ValueError: Unknown constraint decimal_places`
