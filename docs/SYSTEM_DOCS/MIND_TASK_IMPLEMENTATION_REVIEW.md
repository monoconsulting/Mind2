# Mind System — Task Implementation Review (T001–T011)

Date: 2025-09-20
Scope: Verify that everything defined from project start up to the last checked task in specs/001-mind-system-receipt/tasks.md is implemented and functioning in code. Cross-checked against plan.md, data-model.md, research.md, spec.md, and docs/MIND_TECHNICAL_PLAN_v2.0.md.

## Method
- Read tasks and specs to determine the last checked task (T011).
- Inspect code/layout for each task’s deliverables and referenced paths.
- Run a local Flask test-client smoke to exercise the core endpoints and confirm 200 responses without external services.

## Summary
- T001–T011 are present and implement the described scaffolding, models, DB helpers, contracts, and basic endpoints. Contract and integration tests exist and are currently designed to target a running service (via Nginx) and will fail unless the service is running and `MIND_API_BASE` is set accordingly.
- Minimal implementations for T012–T014 endpoints already exist (return 200 with placeholder data), even though these tasks are not yet checked in tasks.md.

## Findings by Task

- T001 Initialize backend structure — VERIFIED
  - Evidence: `backend/src/`, `backend/tests/`, `database/migrations/`, `backend/README.md`.

- T002 Add dependencies — VERIFIED
  - Evidence: `requirements.txt` includes Flask, Celery, Redis, MySQL client, Prometheus client, pytest/cov, requests, PyYAML, pre-commit, black, isort, flake8.

- T003 Linting/formatting — VERIFIED
  - Evidence: `.flake8`, `pyproject.toml` (black/isort config), `.pre-commit-config.yaml`, `.editorconfig`.

- T004 Docker Compose profiles + env templates — VERIFIED
  - Evidence: `docker-compose.yml` defines profiles (main, monitoring) and services; `.env.example` contains DB/Redis/JWT/CORS/flags.

- T005 Nginx proxy + ports ledger — VERIFIED
  - Evidence: `nginx/nginx.conf` proxies `/ai/api` → Flask; `docs/MIND_PORTS.md` lists active and deprecated ports (PHP UI/API and phpMyAdmin marked deprecated).

- T006 Contract tests: Receipts API — VERIFIED (tests present)
  - Evidence: `backend/tests/contract/test_receipts_api.py` uses `specs/.../contracts/receipts.yaml` and asserts 200 from `/receipts`.

- T007 Contract tests: FirstCard API — VERIFIED (tests present)
  - Evidence: `backend/tests/contract/test_firstcard_api.py` uses `specs/.../contracts/reconciliation_firstcard.yaml` and asserts 200 for import/match.

- T008 Contract tests: Export API — VERIFIED (tests present)
  - Evidence: `backend/tests/contract/test_export_api.py` uses `specs/.../contracts/export.yaml` and asserts 200 for `/export/sie`.

- T009 Integration tests from quickstart — VERIFIED (tests present)
  - Evidence: `backend/tests/integration/test_end_to_end.py` exercises `/ingest/upload`, `/receipts`, `/reconciliation/firstcard/match`, `/export/sie`.
  - Note: Tests target `base_url` from `backend/tests/conftest.py` and expect a running service. They will fail unless the API is running and reachable (or `MIND_API_BASE` is overridden).

- T010 Implement data models — VERIFIED
  - Evidence: `backend/src/models/` implements entities per `specs/.../data-model.md`:
    - Receipts: `receipts.py` (Receipt, LineItem, ReceiptStatus, ValidationReport, ValidationMessage, Severity, AccountingEntry)
    - Catalog: `catalog.py` (Tag, Company)
    - Company card: `company_card.py` (CompanyCardInvoice, CompanyCardLine)
    - Accounting: `accounting.py` (AccountingRule)
    - Exports: `exports.py` (ExportJob)
  - `backend/src/models/__init__.py` re-exports all, matching task list.

- T011 DB layer and migrations — VERIFIED
  - Evidence: `backend/src/services/db/connection.py` (env-driven MySQL connector + context manager); `backend/src/services/db/migrations.py` (applies `*.sql` idempotently); `database/migrations/0001_unified-migration-fixed.sql`, `0002_ai_schema_extension.sql`.
  - Behavior: API code treats DB as optional during early scaffolding; endpoints return 200 with empty/placeholder data if DB is unavailable.

## Contracts vs. Endpoints
- Contracts present: `specs/.../contracts/receipts.yaml`, `reconciliation_firstcard.yaml`, `export.yaml`.
- Implemented blueprints (minimal but working):
  - `GET /receipts`, `GET /receipts/{id}`, `PUT /receipts/{id}`, `GET /receipts/monthly-summary` in `backend/src/api/receipts.py`.
  - `POST /reconciliation/firstcard/import`, `POST /reconciliation/firstcard/match`, `GET /reconciliation/firstcard/statements`, `POST /reconciliation/firstcard/statements/{id}/confirm`, `.../reject` in `backend/src/api/reconciliation_firstcard.py`.
  - `GET /export/sie` in `backend/src/api/export.py`.
  - Integration helper: `POST /ingest/upload` in `backend/src/api/app.py`.

## Local Smoke Verification
Executed with Flask test client (no external services) to validate 200 responses:

```
/receipts 200
/receipts/TEST-ID 200
/receipts/monthly-summary 200
/ingest/upload 200
/reconciliation/firstcard/match 200
/reconciliation/firstcard/import 200
/export/sie 200
```

Command used (PowerShell snippet writing and running a temp Python script):
- Inserted `backend/src` onto `sys.path`, imported `api.app`, used `app.test_client()` to request endpoints.

## Alignment With Technical Plan
- docs/MIND_TECHNICAL_PLAN_v2.0.md outlines endpoints, deprecations, and canonical migration order; implemented files and configs align with the plan (unified → ai; invoice schema to come in a later migration per the plan’s §5).

## Gaps / Notes (Pre-T012)
- Tests (T006–T009) are present but assume a running service behind Nginx at `http://localhost:8008/ai/api` by default. To run them locally without Docker/Nginx, start the Flask app and set `MIND_API_BASE=http://127.0.0.1:5000` before `pytest`.
- DB-backed behavior is intentionally minimal; when DB is not reachable, endpoints return 200 with empty or placeholder payloads. Full functionality (queries, updates, aggregation) will mature under T012–T018.

## Recommended Next Steps (Beyond T011)
- T012–T014: Flesh out business logic and DB interactions behind existing endpoints; add schema validations and error handling.
- T015–T018: Implement Celery tasks and services (validation, enrichment, accounting) using the models.
- T019–T022: Queue wiring, structured logging, metrics, auth/CORS middleware, and storage handlers.
- T023–T026: Unit/perf tests, docs, and security hardening.

## How to Reproduce Locally
- Install deps: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Run API: `python -m api.app` (with `PYTHONPATH=backend/src` or run from inside `backend/src`)
- Point tests: `set MIND_API_BASE=http://127.0.0.1:5000` (Windows PowerShell: `$env:MIND_API_BASE='http://127.0.0.1:5000'`)
- Run subset: `pytest backend/tests/contract -q`

---
This review confirms T001–T011 are implemented and minimally functioning per scope, with placeholders where later tasks (T012+) will deliver full behavior.
