Darkmind Design – Implementation Guide

This document explains how to install and integrate the Darkmind Design package into your receiving system. It covers only the UI/UX design implementation — no backend or business logic is included.

1. Prerequisites

Before installing, make sure the following tools are installed on your system:

Node.js (LTS version recommended)

npm (comes with Node.js) or yarn (if preferred)

A modern build environment (e.g., Webpack, Vite, or other bundlers supported by your project)

Git (optional, for version control)

2. Installation

Copy Design Files

Extract the contents of darkmind_design.zip.

Place the extracted folder (darkmind_css/ and other assets) into your project’s frontend/ or assets/ directory.

Install Dependencies
Open a terminal in the root of the extracted design package and run:

npm install


This will install all required dependencies from package.json.

Build the Design
Once dependencies are installed, compile the design assets:

npm run build


The compiled output will typically be placed in a dist/ or build/ folder (depending on the configuration in package.json).

3. Integration in Your System

Link CSS & JS Files

Copy the generated CSS and JS files from dist/ into your main project’s public/ or static/ directory.

Add the following links to your main HTML template:

<link rel="stylesheet" href="/path-to-your-dist/styles.css">
<script src="/path-to-your-dist/main.js" defer></script>


Apply Global Styles

Ensure that your HTML body tag uses the correct classes specified in the design system (check index.html or styles.css for defaults).

The design uses responsive layouts, so confirm that your <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"> tag is present.

Component Integration

The design likely includes reusable components (buttons, cards, navigation, etc.).

Copy these components or reference them directly if using a component framework (React/Vue/Svelte).

Follow the class naming convention provided in the CSS files to maintain consistent styling.

Customizing the Theme

Edit variables in tailwind.config.js or CSS variables if you want to change colors, typography, or spacing.

Rebuild the design after making changes:

npm run build

4. Testing

Open your application in a browser and verify that:

The dark theme and overall design match the original mockups.

Components scale properly on desktop, tablet, and mobile.

Fonts, icons, and spacing look identical to the provided design.
