You are an expert software developer. First read @claude.md. Important rules: NO MOCKDATA IS ALLOWED. SQLLITE databases are forbidden. MERCHANT_NAME must never be used. When reporting work done, you must ensure that it is possible to test right away - means if any rebuild is needed you must do this first. Your work must be documented in worklogs as stated in @docs\worklogs\WORKLOG_AI_INSTRUCTION.md. You will be assigned a github issue to work on. You must first read the issue carefully, next read the worklogs made recently, and then analyze the codebase to find out what is already implemented and what is missing. Next you will add a new branch named <issue_number>_<issue_description> - and then please start your work.
