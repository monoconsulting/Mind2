# Mind2 Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Code Quality Standards (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
All code MUST adhere to strict quality standards: clean architecture with clear separation of concerns, comprehensive documentation for all public interfaces, consistent naming conventions across the codebase, zero tolerance for code smells or technical debt accumulation. Every merge request undergoes mandatory static analysis and code review. Quality gates MUST pass before deployment.

Rationale: Code quality directly impacts maintainability, developer productivity, and system reliability. Poor quality code compounds into technical debt that slows feature development and increases bug rates.

### II. Test-Driven Development (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
TDD cycle is strictly enforced: write failing tests first, implement minimal code to pass tests, refactor while maintaining test coverage. Minimum 90% code coverage required for all new features. Contract tests MUST be written before API implementation. Integration tests are mandatory for all inter-service communication and shared schemas.

Rationale: TDD ensures code correctness, prevents regressions, and creates living documentation. High test coverage provides confidence for refactoring and enables rapid iteration.

### III. User Experience Consistency
All user interfaces (CLI, API responses, documentation) MUST follow consistent patterns: standardized error messages with actionable guidance, uniform JSON response structures across APIs, consistent CLI argument patterns and help text formatting. User journeys MUST be validated through usability testing before release.

Rationale: Consistent UX reduces cognitive load, improves adoption rates, and creates professional user experiences that build trust and reduce support overhead.

### IV. Performance Standards
All systems MUST meet defined performance benchmarks: API responses under 200ms p95 latency, CLI commands complete within 5 seconds for standard operations, memory usage under 100MB for typical workloads. Performance regression tests are mandatory. Resource consumption MUST be monitored and optimized continuously.

Rationale: Performance directly impacts user satisfaction and system scalability. Performance regressions are expensive to fix after deployment and erode user trust.

### V. Template-Driven Development
All development workflows MUST use standardized templates: feature specifications, implementation plans, task breakdowns, and handover documentation. Templates ensure consistency, completeness, and knowledge transfer. Custom workflows require constitutional approval and template updates.

Rationale: Templates reduce cognitive overhead, ensure nothing is missed, enable team scaling, and maintain institutional knowledge across agent handovers.

## Quality Gates

All code changes MUST pass these gates before merge:
- Automated test suite with 90%+ coverage
- Static analysis with zero critical issues
- Performance benchmarks within acceptable ranges
- Code review approval from qualified reviewer
- Documentation updates for public interfaces
- Template compliance for specifications and tasks

Security requirements:
- Dependency vulnerability scanning
- Secrets detection and prevention
- Input validation for all external interfaces
- Error handling that doesn't leak sensitive information

## Development Workflow

Feature development follows this mandatory sequence:
1. Feature specification using spec-template.md
2. Implementation plan using plan-template.md
3. Task breakdown using tasks-template.md
4. Test-first implementation with continuous integration
5. Code review and quality gate validation
6. Deployment with monitoring and rollback capability
7. Handover documentation using handover-template.md

Branch strategy:
- Feature branches from dev: TM###-feature-name
- All changes via pull requests with review
- Automated testing on all branches
- Dev branch protected with required status checks

## Governance

This constitution supersedes all other development practices and guidelines. All team members and AI agents MUST comply with these principles without exception.

Amendment process:
- Constitutional changes require documented rationale and impact analysis
- Template updates MUST maintain backward compatibility or include migration plans
- Version increments follow semantic versioning: MAJOR for breaking governance changes, MINOR for new principles/sections, PATCH for clarifications

Compliance verification:
- All pull requests MUST verify constitutional compliance
- Complexity deviations require explicit justification and approval
- Regular audits ensure ongoing adherence to principles
- Agent guidance files MUST reference current constitution version
